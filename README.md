This is going to be a series of tools to aid with the running of, and participation in, Ars Magica campaigns.  The tool sets will be split into 3 categories, to be fleshed out later.

1) Character Tools
 * Character Creation, choose from Mage, Companion, Grog, Mythical Companion, and custom rules
 * Select which books to include/exclude
 * Generates a "live" character sheet that should provide applicable roll values

 2) Covenant Tools
 * Vis tracking, automatic (for sources that are auto success) and reminders for manual checks
 * Automatic Aura upgrade/downgrade checks/reminders (Optional, can be turned off)
 * Laboratory creation and automatic calculation if a character is assigned to it
 * Character assignment to Covenant
 * Simple or complex laboratory customization rules (simple will mimic the custom homebrew system my campaign uses, complex will use the book rules if I get to it)
 * Finance management (My campaign hand waves most of this, so will be a later addition)
 * Mundane management (Automatic aging, simple/complex systems)
 * Possibly crafter slot assignments to aid with covenant finances

3) Campaign Tools
 * Ability to assign convenants (and all their assigned characters) as well as individual characters
 * Random event generators (Vis sources, monster encounters, political happenings?)
 * Twilight scar suggestions / twilight tools
 * ??? other tools

4) NPC Tools (Later addition)
 * Rules for creating Fey / Demon / Angelic / Magic monsters and NPCs
